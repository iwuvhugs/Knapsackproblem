    <string name="cool_ctory">Hi! My name is Kirill.
        \nI\'m an IT student at Lambton College.
        \n\nThis is my solution for Developer Intern test task.
        I solve it in 2 ways.
        \nFirst is Greedy Algorithm that is quite fast and
        result satisfies the conditions.
        \nSecond is Genetic Algorithm
        that can be limited in time manually
        (that is why it calculates pretty long time) but
        it is also less dependent on raw data than Greedy one.
        \nI don\'t solve the task with Brute Force and Branch and Bound Algorithms
        because they are not efficient for big initial raw data.
        And I skip Dynamic Algorithm because I don\'t know how it works yet :)
        \n\nThanks for that task! I had a great time solving in during New Year break.
