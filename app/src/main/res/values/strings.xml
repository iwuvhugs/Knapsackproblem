    <string name="cool_ctory">Hi! My name is Kirill.
        \nI\'m an IT student at Lambton College.
        \n\nThis is my solution for Developer Intern test task.
        I solve it in 3 ways.
        \n1) Greedy Algorithm. Fast and
        result satisfies the conditions.
        \n2) Genetic Algorithm. Can be limited in time manually
        (that is why it calculates pretty long time) but
        it\'s less dependent on input data than Greedy one, pretty accurate.
        \n3) Harmonic Algorithm. Faster than Genetic one, but way more dependent on
        input data. Doesn\'t realy work with these diverse items.
        \n\nThanks for that task! I had a great time solving it during New Year break.
